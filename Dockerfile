# WHY ? -> This efficiently installs Python dependencies by taking advantage of Docker's caching mechanisms.
# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.
# Leverage a cache mount to /root/.cache/pip to speed up subsequent builds.
# Leverage a bind mount to requirements.txt to avoid having to copy them into
# into this layer.

# Docker's cache allows reusing previous build layers, speeding up subsequent builds.
# By using cache mounts for pip's cache directory and binding the requirements.txt file, 
# the installation process can be efficient without copying the entire source.
